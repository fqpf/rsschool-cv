### About me 

I worked for five years in the video production sphere.

At some moment, I decided to change my job and try myself in something new. I felt like programming seems to be quite a fascinating sphere.

I enjoy being involved in product creation(in my experience - video). I like a lot to investigate how to present a product to the consumer. So, it's given me an idea to try frontend development. And I liked it. Sometimes it could be not easy, but still joyful.

A `Big World` opened for me now :)
